## 2025-02-23 - Improve Form Accessibility
**Learning:** Standard `Input` components often miss programmatic associations between labels, inputs, and error messages, making them inaccessible to screen readers.
**Action:** Use `React.useId()` to auto-generate unique IDs and link elements via `htmlFor`, `aria-describedby`, and `aria-invalid` by default in all form components.

## 2025-05-20 - Icon-only buttons lack accessible names
**Learning:** The `Button` component allows icon-only usage without enforcing an accessible name (via `aria-label` or `children`), leading to inaccessible controls.
**Action:** When using icon-only `Button`, always verify that an `aria-label` is provided, especially for critical actions like "Edit" or "Delete".
