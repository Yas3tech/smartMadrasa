## 2025-02-23 - Improve Form Accessibility

**Learning:** Standard `Input` components often miss programmatic associations between labels, inputs, and error messages, making them inaccessible to screen readers.
**Action:** Use `React.useId()` to auto-generate unique IDs and link elements via `htmlFor`, `aria-describedby`, and `aria-invalid` by default in all form components.

## 2025-05-20 - Icon-only buttons lack accessible names

**Learning:** The `Button` component allows icon-only usage without enforcing an accessible name (via `aria-label` or `children`), leading to inaccessible controls.
**Action:** When using icon-only `Button`, always verify that an `aria-label` is provided, especially for critical actions like "Edit" or "Delete".

## 2024-03-07 - Icon-only Toolbar Buttons Accessibility
**Learning:** Icon-only toolbar buttons often rely solely on the `title` attribute for tooltips, which is insufficient for screen readers and keyboard users. Furthermore, relying on `hover` pseudo-classes for interactivity indication fails to accommodate keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Always ensure icon-only buttons have explicit `aria-label` attributes (often matching the `title`) and use `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-orange-500` (or appropriate thematic color) to provide clear visual feedback for tab-based navigation.

## 2025-02-24 - Focus Indicators on Icon-Only Controls
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons often lack explicit focus rings or outlines, making it nearly impossible for keyboard users to identify their current position within lists or modals. Relying solely on background hover colors is insufficient.
**Action:** Add `focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-orange-500` consistently to all interactive elements to ensure a highly visible focus indicator specifically for keyboard navigation.
